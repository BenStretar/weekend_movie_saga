# The Movie Gallery

## Description

Duration: 2 Days

This is an application that displays movies from a database in alphabetical order. Users can edit both the title and description of the movies.

## Installation

1. Create a database called: saga_movies_weekend
2. Use the tables listed in the database.sql file to build your database tables. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Run npm install in your editor of choice
4.  In separate terminals run npm run server and npm run client (in that order)
